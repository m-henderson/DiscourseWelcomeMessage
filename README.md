# What It Does
This script was built to run daily to complete any needs you have for your Discourse Form.

For example, I want to send my new users a welcome message. 

So, I run this script once a day
and it checks for new users. If there are new users it sends them a private message with a friendly 
greeting

# How To Run The Script
1. You need Ruby installed and a discourse API key.
2. Plug in your forum url, username, and API key into the config.yml
3. Run the script. 

I am working on make this an executable so you can run it interactivly without having to install ruby gems, edit files, etc.

I want you to be able to download a release and run it!

# The Future of This Repo
Currently, this script only sends a welcome message to new users. 

I would like to add on to this codebase and make it capable of doing other things to enhance your Discourse forum and make your life easier!
